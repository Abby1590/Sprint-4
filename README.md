# Vehicle Listings Data Analysis
https://sprint-4-wwsm.onrender.com/


## Project Overview
This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** designed to provide **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of vehicle listings. The app utilizes various **Plotly Express visualizations** to explore patterns and insights in the dataset, such as vehicle conditions, fuel types, and listing durations.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how to perform EDA using Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit, while also offering an interactive way for users to explore the dataset.
